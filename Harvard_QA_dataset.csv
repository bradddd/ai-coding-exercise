How important are extracurricular activities in admissions decisions?,"Each case is different. Some students distinguish themselves for admission with their unusual academic promise through experience or achievements in study or research. Other students present compelling cases because they are more "well-rounded," having contributed in many different ways to their schools or communities. Still other successful applicants are "well-lopsided" with demonstrated excellence in one particular endeavor. Some students bring perspectives formed by unusual personal circumstances or experiences. Like many colleges, we seek to admit dynamic, talented, and diverse students who will contribute significantly to the education of their classmates."
Are there secondary school course requirements for admission?,"There is no single academic path we expect all students to follow, but the strongest applicants take the most rigorous secondary school curricula available to them. An ideal four-year preparatory program includes four years of English, with extensive practice in writing; four years of math; four years of science: biology, chemistry, physics, and an advanced course in one of these subjects; three years of history, including American and European history; and four years of one foreign language."
"Will it help me to take advanced, accelerated or honors courses?","Yes. Although schools provide different opportunities, students should pursue the most demanding college-preparatory program available, consistent with each student's readiness for particular fields of study. Counselors can offer helpful advice as students choose their courses."
Do I need certain grades or marks to be considered for admission?,"We recognize that schools vary by size, academic program, and grading policies, so we do not have rigid grade requirements. There is no single academic path we expect all students to follow, but the strongest applicants take the most rigorous secondary school curricula available to them. We do seek students who achieve at a high level, and most admitted students rank in the top 10-15% of their graduating classes."
Are my chances of admission enhanced if a relative has attended Harvard?,"The application process is the same for all candidates. Among a group of similarly distinguished applicants, the daughters and sons of Harvard College alumni/ae may receive an additional look."
"If my curriculum requires more than the 12-year U.S. curriculum, may I apply after my twelfth year?","We strongly recommend you to complete whichever curriculum you have been following. Applicants who have completed only a year of GCE A-levels or International Baccalaureate study, for instance, are at a tremendous disadvantage in our applicant pool."
Can I fulfill academic requirements with previous coursework?,"You cannot receive credit for coursework completed before matriculation, but Harvard offers an Advanced Standing Program to entering students who meet certain standards on the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) examinations or who have earned the full International Baccalaureate Diploma with a grade of 7 on at least three Higher Level examinations. Admitted students with strong results on internationally recognized examinations, such as the GCE A-levels, Abitur, or French Baccalaureate, may submit their credentials to the Advanced Standing adviser for individual evaluation upon matriculation. Visit the Advising Programs Office website for more information about Advanced Standing."
I was deferred. Is there really any chance that I still can be admitted?,"It is impossible to predict individual admission decisions. Past students whose applications were deferred have been admitted at various rates, often approximating the rate for Regular Decision candidates. Over the next few months, your application will be reviewed again, supplying another opportunity for eventual admission."
I was deferred. What can I do to improve my chances of admission?,"Further updates may enhance your prospects, although in most cases, the essential details already are on file with the Admissions Committee. Additional information should be limited to significant developments in your high school career."
Do I need to communicate directly with the admissions staff member who read my file about my deferral?,"Despite what you may hear or read elsewhere, no; this is wholly unnecessary. Our decisions are made by a committee of admission officers, including faculty members, no single one of whom is responsible for shaping the outcome of deliberations."
May I apply to another college under its Regular Decision plan before I receive Harvard's decision on my Restrictive Early Action application?,Yes. You may apply in the fall to any institution under its Regular Decision program.
"If I apply restrictive  early action to Harvard, may I apply to another college's early decision program?","After students receive notification from Harvard's Early Action program in mid-December, they are free to apply to any institution under any plan, including binding programs such as Early Decision II."
"If I apply restrictive early action to Harvard, may I apply to another private college's early action program (restrictive or not)?","No. However, you may apply Early Action to any public college/university or to foreign universities."
I am applying to colleges outside of the U.S. May I apply to them at the same time as I apply Early Action to Harvard?,Yes.
Why was my application deferred?,"Competition for early admission to Harvard College has, in recent years, been especially rigorous. Given that more than 39,000 candidates apply from around the world, and the relatively modest size of each entering class (about 1,660 students), the Admissions Committee must act with great care in making Early Action Decisions. As a result, many strong applicants are deferred to the Regular Decision round for review."
Does Harvard consider scores from previous administrations of the SAT or ACT?,Yes.
What if I cannot take the SAT or ACT in my country?,"These standardized tests are now given in almost all countries. We realize you may have to travel some distance or plan for testing long in advance, but these test results are required tools in our analysis of applications. In our competitive applicant pool, students lacking these test results are usually denied admission. Foreign students in one of the very few countries where the SAT is not available (for example, China) may submit alternative testing such as the Graduate Record Examination. For more information about the GRE, consult www.gre.org. Students in such countries should also take the TOEFL."
Does Harvard accept the redesigned SAT?,Harvard accepts both the current SAT and the redesigned SAT and will accept both tests for the foreseeable future. You should submit scores from tests taken in the past three years.
Can I self-report my test scores?,"Beginning with the 2018-2019 application cycle (students applying for Fall 2019 admission), applicants may provide self-reported SAT and ACT test scores (including Subject Tests, Advanced Placement, etc.). Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official test scores. View our application tips for specific information on how to self-report your scores. If you were eligible for a fee waiver from the SAT or ACT, you are eligible for unlimited free score reports to be sent to institutions to which you are applying.  We recommend you use your free score reports to share your scores with Harvard. "
Which standardized tests does Harvard require?,"We require all applicants to complete the SAT or the ACT with or without Writing, and we recommend submitting two SAT Subject Tests, except in the case of financial hardship. If you choose to submit Subject Tests, it is more useful to choose only one mathematics test rather than two. Similarly, if your first language is not English, a Subject Test in your first language may be less helpful. For information about the SATs, consult www.collegeboard.org, for the ACT www.act.org. We value predicted A-level and IB results along with any information that helps us form a complete picture of your academic interests and strengths. However, results from these examinations cannot substitute for our required admissions testing.  If the cost of sending your scores is a concern, keep in mind that if you were eligible for a fee waiver from the SAT or ACT, you are eligible for unlimited free score reports to be sent to institutions to which you are applying.  We recommend you use your free score reports to share your scores with Harvard. "
Does Harvard superscore test results?,We do not create superscores for applicants. We will evaluate your application noting the highest test scores in each section across test dates for the SAT and your strongest sitting for the ACT.  We take into account your educational background when reviewing your scores.
"If I take the required tests more than once, which results does Harvard consider?","We consider your best test scores, but it is generally our experience that taking tests more than twice offers diminishing returns."
"If I sit for GCE A-levels or other international credentials, must I submit SAT or ACT scores?","Yes. We realize students educated abroad may be unfamiliar with these examination formats or may have followed a different syllabus, but all applicants must submit the results of the SAT or ACT (with or without writing) and we recommend submitting two SAT Subject Tests, except in the case of financial hardship."
"Do I need a minimum required SAT, ACT or Subject Test score?","There are no score cutoffs, and we do not admit "by the numbers." For the SAT, we will review your highest test scores in each section across test dates and any other scores you choose to share with us. For the ACT, we will evaluate your highest composite score and any other scores you choose to share with us.  We take into account your educational background when reviewing your scores. You are free to use the College Board's Score Choice option and/or the similar option offered by ACT when applying to Harvard, but you do not need to. The majority of students admitted represent a range of scores from roughly 600 to 800 on each section of the SAT as well as on the SAT Subject Tests. The 25th percentile for admitted students on the SAT is about 1470; the 75th percentile is about 1570. We regard test results as helpful indicators of academic ability and achievement when considered thoughtfully among many other factors."
What admissions criteria do you use?,"There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, his or her ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities."
I have a bachelor's degree. May I apply to Harvard College?,"No student with a bachelor's degree or other first university degree from any other university, whether American or foreign, is eligible for admission to Harvard College. Students interested in continuing their studies beyond the bachelor's degree might wish to consider one of the 10 Harvard University graduate schools. The Harvard College Admissions Office is independent of these schools and their admissions policies."
How familiar is the Admissions Committee with secondary schools? Their rigor? What marks mean in a particular school or educational system?,"We have worked hard for many years to learn about schools around the world. Our careful study of different schools, curricula and educational systems is augmented by information we receive directly from schools, extensive personal communication with school personnel, and the interview reports we receive from our alumni, who meet thousands of applicants to Harvard each year. We can always learn more, so we welcome information students think might be helpful to the Admissions Committee in understanding their accomplishments in their school communities."
Does Harvard rank secondary schools in the U.S. and abroad?,"No. While we understand there are differences in the overall strengths of secondary schools, we are most interested in how well applicants have taken advantage of available resources. In the end, we admit the student not the secondary school they attend."
Who should write my recommendations?,"Teachers who know you well and who have taught you in academic subjects (preferably in the final two years of secondary school) typically will provide us with the most valuable testimony. Whenever possible, teachers should tell us about your non-academic interests and personal qualities as well as academic potential."
Who reads applications?,"Applications are read by members of the forty-person Admissions Committee, and are considered very carefully in a series of committee meetings where a majority vote is required for admission. The entire process requires several months."
Is there a wait list?,"Yes. Our wait list includes the applicants whom the Committee might still wish to consider for admission if spots in the entering class open later. The wait list is not ranked. In some years, we have admitted no one from the wait list; in others, we have admitted more than 200 candidates."
Does Harvard admit students to enter in the spring semester?,No. All students begin study in September to benefit from special programs designed for freshmen.
Are there quotas for certain kinds of applicants?,The Admissions Committee does not use quotas of any kind.
Are my chances of admission enhanced by submitting application materials before other applicants?,"No. We request, however, that Early Action applicants submit the Common Application or the Universal College Application and the Application Supplements by October 15 and Regular Decision applicants by December 15. The deadlines are November 1 and January 1 respectively. Receipt of these two forms allows us to expedite application processing and to arrange personal interviews more quickly."
May I defer my admission once admitted?,"Yes. We want to do everything possible to help the students we enroll make the most of their opportunities, avoiding the much reported "burnout" phenomenon that can keep them from reaching their full potential. Our overall graduation rate of 98%, among the highest in the nation, is perhaps due in part to the fact that so many students take time off, before or during college. The Admissions Committee encourages admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to travel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way-provided they do not enroll in a degree-granting program at another college. Deferrals for two-year military service are also granted. Each year, between 80 and 110 students defer their matriculation to the College, and they report their experiences to be uniformly positive. After graduation, large numbers of Harvard students take time off before beginning work or graduate school. See more about taking time off."
May I apply to Harvard if I am admitted under a binding Early Decision program at another college?,"No. If you are admitted under an Early Decision program at another college, you must withdraw any pending application to Harvard and you are not eligible for admission."
Is there an interview?,"When possible, we try to arrange for you to meet with alumni/ae in or near your school communities. You will not be at a disadvantage if an interview cannot be arranged. In the U.S., Canada and the U.K., an alumnus/a will contact an applicant directly by phone, e-mail, or letter if such an interview is possible. If you live outside these areas, we aim to hold an admission interview when and where possible. Our interviewers abroad are graduates of Harvard who offer their assistance on a volunteer basis. While we try to make interviewers as widely available as possible, it will not always be possible for a student to have an interview. The absence of an interview will not adversely affect your candidacy. See more about international interviews."
Is there a separate admissions process for prospective athletes?,No. We encourage students with athletic talent to contact our Athletic Department for information about any of Harvard's 42 varsity athletic teams.
Are there quotas for international applicants?,"There are no quotas or limits of any kind at any point in the admissions process. All students are considered in the same pool for all places in the incoming class, regardless of citizenship or the secondary school they attend. A student's chances for admission and financial aid are not affected by citizenship or by the location of the school that the student attends."
What should students know about visas?,Admitted international students will be provided with information about applying for a student visa.
Does Harvard consider legal immigration status in the admissions process?,"All students are considered in the same pool for admission to the incoming class regardless of citizenship status. While being undocumented may present challenges for students wishing to travel or work on campus, immigration status is not considered by the admissions committee."
Does Harvard offer admission application fee waivers to international students?,"Yes! If paying the application fee would cause a hardship for your family, please request a fee waiver. You or your guidance counselor may write a short letter asking us to waive your fee. Receiving a fee waiver has no effect on admissions chances. Please use the following e-mail address: intlfeewaiver@fas.harvard.edu to submit your application fee waiver request."
I applied as a freshman or transfer applicant previously. Do I need to submit my standardized test scores again as a transfer applicant?,Yes. Standardized test scores are only retained in our system for the year of application; therefore the scores will need to be reported again for your new application.
What if English is not my first language?,"A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and express thoughts quickly and clearly. We require the results of the SAT or ACT (with or without writing) and two SAT Subject Tests for all candidates. The SAT English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT) is not acceptable. Students are not required to submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) unless the SAT exams are not available in their current location. Candidates whose native language is not English should not take the SAT Subject Test in their native language to fulfill one of their two required tests."
What percentage of faculty members teach undergraduates?,Virtually 100 percent.
How large are classes?,"Some introductory courses as well as several other popular courses have large enrollments. Yet, the median class size at Harvard is 12. Of the nearly 1,300 courses offered last fall, for example, more than 1,000 of them enrolled 20 or fewer students."
Is it possible to get to know my professors?,"Yes. In addition to weekly office hours, students often spend time with their professors before and after class. There are also many occasions when professors take meals in Harvard's 12 residential dining halls; attend gatherings in the residences of Faculty Deans, who are themselves Harvard faculty members; and participate in other programs and special events."
What security measures are in place at Harvard?,"Harvard has a comprehensive public safety program that includes a full campus police force, a walking escort service, a campus-wide shuttle service, emergency phones, lighted pathways and a computer-card key system operating in all residential buildings. Read Harvard's "Playing It Safe" handbook at the Harvard University Police Department website."
Is on-campus housing guaranteed?,"Harvard guarantees housing for all four years. Freshmen live in one of the 17 dormitories in or adjacent to historic Harvard Yard. Self-selected groups of students are assigned to one of 12 residential Houses for the final three years of undergraduate study. About 350 to 500 students live in a House, each of which includes its own dining hall, library, advising staff, and many other resources. Read more about residential life."
Must I live on campus?,"You must live in Harvard housing your first year at the College. A very small percentage of students choose to live off-campus as upperclassmen. Most students and alumni consider the House system one of the hallmarks of their Harvard experiences. Considering the diversity of student backgrounds, interests and talents, Harvard's residential program enhances the degree to which students learn from one another."
What will my room look like?,"Most freshman dorms have suites for three to six students. Suites contain from two to four bedrooms and a common room. A few have their own baths, though most share a bathroom with other suites. The Freshman Dean's Office assigns students to suites rather than to particular bedrooms, and in almost any suite students should expect to share a bedroom for at least part of the first year. Some dorms contain doubles, usually one fairly large room with a shared bath."
Where will I take my meals?,"Freshmen students all eat together in Annenberg Hall. During sophomore through senior year, students typically eat in the dining hall located within their Houses, although students can choose to eat at other House dining halls as well. See more about dining."
What extracurricular opportunities are available?,"There are more than 400 student-run organizations at Harvard, among them dozens of publications, five orchestras, an extensive community service program, more than 40 intercollegiate athletic teams, and a broad assortment of other activities-artistic, musical, political, and social. We encourage and support extracurricular opportunities as these provide important settings for personal growth and friendships. Visit the Office of Student Life website for more information about extracurriculars."
How easy is it to change my concentration?,"About a third of undergraduates change fields after declaring their concentrations, which students do midway through their sophomore year. You would simply change concentrations in consultation with your departmental advisers. Learn more about the breadth of Harvard's academic programs."
What should I know about Harvard's science and engineering programs?,"Science and engineering have long been priorities at Harvard. There are more than two dozen state-of-the-art facilities for science research at Harvard, and new computer science and chemistry laboratories opened in 2008. Moreover, forty-one of our former and current science faculty members have won Nobel Prizes. About half of recent entering students intend to major in the natural sciences, engineering, computer science or mathematics. Read more about engineering and applied science at www.seas.harvard.edu."
"Can I concentrate in business, journalism, law or medicine?","While you can take courses related to these fields, Harvard's academic programs are not pre-professional, in that they do not provide vocational training. Many Harvard graduates plan to continue their education in professional or graduate schools, often in these fields. Please note that both medicine and law are postgraduate programs in the United States. If you are not a U.S. citizen but wish to continue your education in a professional program, particularly in an American medical school, we advise you to consult specific graduate and professional programs in advance to understand those schools' admissions and financial aid policies concerning international students."
Can I fulfill academic requirements with previous coursework?,"You cannot receive credit for coursework completed before matriculation, but Harvard offers an Advanced Standing Program to entering students who meet certain standards on the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) examinations or who have earned the full International Baccalaureate Diploma with a grade of 7 on at least three Higher Level examinations. Admitted students with strong results on internationally recognized examinations, such as the GCE A-levels, Abitur, or French Baccalaureate, may submit their credentials to the Advanced Standing adviser for individual evaluation upon matriculation. Visit the Advising Programs Office website for more information about Advanced Standing."
Are there required freshman classes?,"Harvard requires all freshmen to take Expository Writing, a one-semester course. Otherwise, you may enroll in any Harvard College courses in which you are interested and for which you are prepared."
Must I register for courses before they begin?,No. You will enjoy a week-long "shopping" period at the start of each semester during which you visit classes and compare curricular choices before registering for classes.
How many courses does Harvard offer?,"Nearly 3,500. For a complete copy of the course catalog, consult www.registrar.fas.harvard.edu."
Are there exchange programs with other Greater Boston colleges?,"You may cross-register in courses offered at MIT, which is a 10-minute trip from Harvard Yard. You may also enroll in graduate-level courses at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as well as at many of Harvard's professional schools."
"What is a ""liberal arts"" education?","In our liberal arts program, students are broadly educated in the social sciences, the natural sciences and the humanities, as well as trained in a particular academic field of specialization called a concentration. Students take one course in each of the eight areas of the General Education Program, which is designed to broaden each student's intellectual perspective, while selecting a field of concentration from more than forty academic departments. Students will usually take about half of their courses in their concentration, one-quarter in the General Education Program, and one-quarter student-chosen electives. The only specific course that is required for all students is a one-semester writing course, although each department has certain courses that a student must take to earn a degree in that field. Programs are, therefore, quite individualized for each student. Whatever a student's curricular choices, every undergraduate learns to read, write, and think critically - skills important to any endeavor. For detailed information, consult the course catalog at www.registrar.fas.harvard.edu."
What campus security measures are in place at Harvard?,"The University sponsors a comprehensive public safety program that includes a full campus police force, a walking escort service, a campus-wide shuttle service, emergency phones, lighted pathways and a computer-card key system operating in all freshman and most other residences. Read Harvard's "Playing It Safe" handbook at the Harvard University Police Department website."
What is Harvard's graduation rate?,"The College's graduation rate is normally 98 percent, among the highest at American colleges and universities. Everyone admitted to Harvard has the ability to complete all academic requirements successfully."
What is the difference between Harvard College and Harvard University?,"Harvard College is the "original" Harvard, founded in 1636 as the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. Harvard College offers a four-year undergraduate, liberal arts program for students seeking their first degree. There are about 6,500 undergraduates at the College, with nearly equal numbers of men and women. In addition to Harvard College, Harvard University includes 10 graduate and professional schools, all of which offer programs for students who already hold their first degrees and seek advanced training in their fields through master's or doctoral programs. All 10 graduate and professional schools maintain their own admissions offices and teaching faculties, and they are run independently of Harvard College. For information about Harvard's graduate programs, please contact these schools' admissions offices directly."
"Will attending Harvard College affect my chances of admission to Harvard University's graduate programs in business, medicine, or law?","Graduate programs are separate from and independent of Harvard College, and each makes its own admissions decisions. Yet Harvard College is almost always the best-represented undergraduate institution at Harvard's graduate schools. In some programs, particularly at Harvard Medical School, foreign citizens may have a smaller representation."
How successful are Harvard students in gaining admission to graduate schools or finding employment after graduation?,Our graduates enjoy an extraordinarily high rate of success receiving job offers and admission to graduate and professional schools. Resident tutors in each of the twelve residential Houses assist students applying to graduate schools and fellowship programs. The Office of Career Services offers all undergraduates a range of job and internship counseling and placement. Foreign citizens should be aware that some special policies pertain should they seek employment in the U.S. after graduation.
What is Harvard's graduation rate?,"The College's graduation rate is normally 98 percent, among the highest at American colleges and universities. Everyone admitted to Harvard has the ability to complete all academic requirements successfully."
What advising and support services are available?,"Woven into Harvard's freshman and upperclassman residences are a variety of academic and other advising resources that make the residential experience at Harvard distinctive. First-year students benefit from the guidance that resident proctors provide about living in Cambridge and studying at the College. Each House also has its own staff of advisers called resident tutors who are similar to first-year proctors but with expertise in particular academic and professional fields. Harvard offers extensive advising resources of other kinds. If you need extra help in coursework, you can turn to the Bureau of Study Counsel. The Office of Career Services offers career counseling. The University maintains its own outstanding health services. The Undergraduate Financial Aid Office will help you with financial aid issues, and the Student Employment Office will help place you in jobs on and off campus. Finally, if you are an international student, the International Office is there for your special needs."
Does Harvard provide services if I have a disability?,"Yes. The Accessible Education Office (AEO) assists students with any impairment limiting their ability to walk, see, hear, speak, learn, or write. Based on each student's successful strategies, the Center collaborates with faculty and staff to ensure individualized accommodation. Accessible housing and transportation are also available. Read more about the AEO."
Are there research opportunities for undergraduates?,"Yes - available to students as early as their freshman year. You may find research projects through individual inquiries with departments and professors, through the Harvard Undergraduate Research Program, or through the Mellon Minority Undergraduate Fellowship Program. The Faculty Aide Program links professors to undergraduates interested in becoming research assistants. Read more about these programs on the Student Employment Office website."
What sort of study abroad programs are available?,"Harvard students study abroad in classroom, laboratory, and field-based immersion programs throughout the world. In addition to greatly expanded study abroad opportunities, other international experiences such as public service internships and employment are offered. Generous funding is available for all students both during the school year and the summer. For more information about study abroad, visit the Office of International Programs website."
Does Harvard provide specific resources for undocumented students?,"Harvard supports all of its students. Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn dela Pena can help direct undocumented students to advisers and counselors in the Bureau of Study Counsel, Office of Career Services, Harvard International Office, Student Employment Office, and University Health Services who can assist them. For legal questions, students may wish to consult an outside immigration attorney. Assistance is also available through Act on a Dream, a student organization that serves as a resource center for undocumented undergraduates at the College."
How do I know if I am competitive/ How hard is it to get in as a transfer student?,"The Harvard College Transfer Admissions Committee evaluates the whole person throughout the app process; therefore there is not a required minimum grade point average (GPA) or test score to apply. However, the transfer admissions pool is very competitive. In recent years, we have admitted 12-16 students from a pool of over 1,500 applicants. The committee looks for a clearly defined academic need to transfer, a proven record of high achievement, and strong faculty recommendations."
Do transfer students qualify for financial aid?,"Yes. All transfer applicants, including international students, are eligible to apply for need-based financial aid. Transfer applicants should follow the prospective student financial aid application instructions."
Is there housing for transfer students on campus?,"Yes. All transfer students who are admitted are eligible for on-campus housing.  Students are not required to live on campus, though nearly all undergraduate students live on campus and House life is  an integral part of the Harvard College community and student experience."
How long does it take for application materials I have submitted to appear as received in my transfer application status?,"Application material processing can take up to three weeks if submitted by mail. This does not affect the March 1st deadline, so long as your materials were submitted (or postmarked) by March 1st."
What courses transfer to Harvard College? Is there a list of transferrable courses?,Harvard College typically accepts courses taken while enrolled as a full-time student in an undergraduate program similar to our liberal arts curriculum.  Our office does not keep a list of transferrable courses. The Committee also looks for strong preparation in the student's expected field of specialization.
Are there interviews for transfer applicants?,"Generally, we do not conduct interviews for transfer applicants. Should the Admissions Committee need more information regarding your application, our office will contact you. Transfer students may not schedule or request their own interviews."
How do I know if you received my transfer application materials?,"Once your application has been received and processed, our office will send a confirmation email with a link to the applicant status portal.

When can I apply as a transfer student?,Students may apply to enter as a sophomore (2nd year) or junior (3rd year) student. Harvard College does not admit students for the spring semester. All transfer applications each year are due by March 1st to enter the fall term of the same calendar year. Transfer applicants who are admitted are not permitted to defer their admission.
I applied as a freshman or transfer applicant previously. Do I need to submit my standardized test scores again as a transfer applicant?,Yes. Standardized test scores are only retained in our system for the year of application; therefore the scores will need to be reported again for your new application.
"I received AP, IB or SAT Subject Test credits towards graduation at my current college or university. Does Harvard accept this credit and how does it affect my eligibility for transfer?","Harvard College does not accept AP, IB or SAT credits for transfer, therefore only those courses taken at your current institution while enrolled full-time will be considered for transfer. As a result, those credits accepted by your current institution from standardized tests are not included in the maximum 16 transferrable course limit under our criteria of eligibility."
I am an international prospective transfer student. What is the transfer application process for me?,"The application process and requirements are exactly the same for international students. Our financial aid program also applies to all applicants regardless of nationality or citizenship. For more information, you can view all of the transfer application requirements here.    "
Can I self-report my test scores?,"Beginning with the 2018-2019 application cycle (students applying for Fall 2019 admission), applicants may provide self-reported SAT and ACT test scores (including Subject Tests, Advanced Placement, etc.). Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official test scores. View our application tips for specific information on how to self-report your scores. If you were eligible for a fee waiver from the SAT or ACT, you are eligible for unlimited free score reports to be sent to institutions to which you are applying.  We recommend you use your free score reports to share your scores with Harvard. "
What are the standardized testing requirements for transfer applicants?,"All transfer applicants are required to have the results of either the SAT I or the ACT (with or without writing), even if you have applied previously for freshman admission. Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to submit the results of two SAT II Subject Tests, except in the case of financial hardship."
Are International Transfer Applicants required to take the SAT or ACT exam?,"Yes. All transfer applicants, including those from outside of the United States, are required to submit the SAT or ACT (with or without writing)."
I am a non-traditional student. Am I still required to submit a standardized test? What about my high school transcript?,"Yes, all transfer applicants are required to submit the SAT or ACT (with or without writing). We encourage non-traditional students to submit an exam taken within three years of applying for transfer to reflect current academic ability. High school transcripts are required for the transfer application evaluation. If you are unable to obtain your high school transcript, please submit a letter from your high school explaining why the transcript is not available."
Is the TOEFL still required even if I have taken classes at a college or university in the United States?,"No, if you are applying for transfer or freshman admission, you will not be expected to submit a TOEFL exam in order to be eligible for admission. However, Visiting Undergraduate Student applicants must submit the TOEFL."
"I submitted my application, but did not receive a confirmation from Harvard. How do I know if you received it?","We begin processing applications in September, and we confirm the receipt of each application to each applicant via email. Once you have submitted your application, we ask that you allow 2 weeks to receive your confirmation. If you have submitted your application more than 2 weeks ago, and still have not received a confirmation, it is likely that our email was undeliverable for some reason. Please check to make sure that your email account settings allow emails from college@fas.harvard.edu and fileroom@fas.harvard.edu. Also, please check any filtered mailboxes for spam/junk email to see if your confirmation was filtered there. If you are still unable to locate your confirmation, it is possible that we have not received your application. If you submitted your application through the Common Application or Universal Application on-line systems, please make sure that you have clicked the button to "Submit" and not just "Save." Once you have made sure that you have actually submitted your application and still have no confirmation, please send us an email with your full name, date of birth, and school. Let us know when you submitted your application and how, so that we may consult our records accordingly."
"I applied under Early Action, but I would like to be considered under Regular Action. Can I change my application? (Or, I applied under Regular Action and would like to be considered under Early Action.)","Please send us an e-mail requesting the change. If possible, we will make the change and send you a confirmation. You do not need to submit a new application; your submitted materials will simply be reviewed on a different time-table."
"I reported my SAT scores to Harvard, but my status page says they haven't been received. Why?","Though you may have ordered your scores, it can sometimes take a couple of weeks for your scores to be officially sent and processed in our office. If your official scores do not show in your status page after a couple of weeks, please double check with the testing agency to make sure they were sent. Once you have confirmed the delivery, please check the name and personal information used on your scores. If this varies, even slightly, from what you have listed on your application, your scores will be automatically stored in a separate entry in our database. If this is the case, you can send an email to scores@fas.harvard.edu listing the discrepancy in your name/info, and your scores will be merged with your application file."
"I did not receive an access code, or my access code for the application status page is not working. Can you give me a new one?","When you submitted your application, a confirmation email was sent to the email address you listed on your application. This email provided you with a link to generate an access code to check the status of your application. However, these e-mails are sent out in bulk, so if you have a spam/junk filter in your email account, you probably did not receive our email in your inbox. Please check any spam box that you may have; if you are still unable to locate our email, please adjust your email account settings to allow bulk emails from college@fas.harvard.edu and fileroom@fas.harvard.edu. You may then visit the Applicant Status page on our website to request your access code."
I submitted something by mistake. Can you remove it from my file?,"Unfortunately, we are not able to remove materials from your file after they have been submitted. However, you may write an explanation of the materials that have been submitted by mistake and/or why you'd like them to be removed, and we will add this new information to your file."
"I submitted the application, but I no longer want to be considered for admission to Harvard College. Can I withdraw my application?","Please send us an e-mail in the form below, using the drop-down "Withdraw Application." Please be sure to write from the e-mail address you used on the Common Application. We are not able to withdraw an application based on a request from someone other than the applicant."
"Have my application materials been received? (Including Common Application forms, or supplemental materials)","Upon receipt of your application, a confirmation email is sent to you with instructions on how to generate your access code. This code is to be used in Applicant Status portal. This feature allows you to view your record in our database to see which required pieces of your application we've received and processed. The data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents, and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty."
My contact information has changed since I submitted my application. How can I correct it?,"You can update your contact information on the Applicant Status Portal. If you need to update information that is not available on the Portal, please contact fileroom@fas.harvard.edu."

How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application?,We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you've submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the Applicant Status Portal.
Paying the application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver?,"Do not let the application fee prevent you from applying! In the spirit of our honor code, if the fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. There are a few ways to request a fee waiver. You can easily request it within the Common Application, Coalition Application, Universal College Application, or simply email us as fileroom@fas.harvard.edu. The Common Application and the Coalition Application outline the indicators of economic need as follows, but if you do not meet any of these indicators, but would still like to request a fee waiver, please do not hesitate to email us. You have received a College Board or NACAC fee waiver You have received or are eligible to receive an ACT or SAT testing fee waiver You are enrolled in or are eligible to participate in the Federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch program (FRPL) Your annual family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service You are enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., TRIO programs such as Upward Bound) Your family receives public assistance You live in federally subsidized public housing, a foster home, or are homeless You are a ward of the state or an orphan You can provide a supporting statement from a school official, college access counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader This step occurs while creating your application in the Common Application, Coalition Application, or Universal College Application. Students who qualify will automatically pass the payment screen upon submitting their application. Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way."
"If my curriculum requires more than the 12-year U.S. curriculum, may I apply after my twelfth year?","We strongly recommend you to complete whichever curriculum you have been following. Applicants who have completed only a year of GCE A-levels or International Baccalaureate study, for instance, are at a tremendous disadvantage in our applicant pool."
I am an international prospective transfer student. What is the transfer application process for me?,"The application process and requirements are exactly the same for international students. Our financial aid program also applies to all applicants regardless of nationality or citizenship. For more information, you can view all of the transfer application requirements here.    "
Is there an interview?,"When possible, we try to arrange for you to meet with alumni/ae in or near your school communities. You will not be at a disadvantage if an interview cannot be arranged. In the U.S., Canada and the U.K., an alumnus/a will contact an applicant directly by phone, e-mail, or letter if such an interview is possible. If you live outside these areas, we aim to hold an admission interview when and where possible. Our interviewers abroad are graduates of Harvard who offer their assistance on a volunteer basis. While we try to make interviewers as widely available as possible, it will not always be possible for a student to have an interview. The absence of an interview will not adversely affect your candidacy. See more about international interviews."
Are there quotas for international applicants?,"There are no quotas or limits of any kind at any point in the admissions process. All students are considered in the same pool for all places in the incoming class, regardless of citizenship or the secondary school they attend. A student's chances for admission and financial aid are not affected by citizenship or by the location of the school that the student attends."
What should students know about visas?,Admitted international students will be provided with information about applying for a student visa.
Does Harvard offer admission application fee waivers to international students?,"Yes! If paying the application fee would cause a hardship for your family, please request a fee waiver. You or your guidance counselor may write a short letter asking us to waive your fee. Receiving a fee waiver has no effect on admissions chances. Please use the following e-mail address: intlfeewaiver@fas.harvard.edu to submit your application fee waiver request."
What if I cannot take the SAT or ACT in my country?,"These standardized tests are now given in almost all countries. We realize you may have to travel some distance or plan for testing long in advance, but these test results are required tools in our analysis of applications. In our competitive applicant pool, students lacking these test results are usually denied admission. Foreign students in one of the very few countries where the SAT is not available (for example, China) may submit alternative testing such as the Graduate Record Examination. For more information about the GRE, consult www.gre.org. Students in such countries should also take the TOEFL."
Are International Transfer Applicants required to take the SAT or ACT exam?,"Yes. All transfer applicants, including those from outside of the United States, are required to submit the SAT or ACT (with or without writing)."
"If I sit for GCE A-levels or other international credentials, must I submit SAT or ACT scores?","Yes. We realize students educated abroad may be unfamiliar with these examination formats or may have followed a different syllabus, but all applicants must submit the results of the SAT or ACT (with or without writing) and we recommend submitting two SAT Subject Tests, except in the case of financial hardship."
What if English is not my first language?,"A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and express thoughts quickly and clearly. We require the results of the SAT or ACT (with or without writing) and two SAT Subject Tests for all candidates. The SAT English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT) is not acceptable. Students are not required to submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) unless the SAT exams are not available in their current location. Candidates whose native language is not English should not take the SAT Subject Test in their native language to fulfill one of their two required tests."
Am I eligible to become a Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS)?,"If you are currently enrolled full-time at an accredited college or university you may apply to spend one or two semesters studying at Harvard College. This program is not for High School Graduates who wish to study at Harvard for a Gap Year. Additionally, since the VUS Program is for full-time undergraduate students only, if you have already achieved the equivalent of a bachelor's degree, you would not be eligible. However, you might be eligible to be a "Special Student" at the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. For more information on this program, please visit their website: http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/special_students_admission "
I am from another country but I speak English proficiently. Do I still need to take the TOEFL?,"Without all of the information about a candidate, we cannot make exceptions to this requirement and time constraints do not allow us to pre-screen all applicants to determine if they are exempt from taking the TOEFL. Therefore, we advise all students whose native language is not English to take the TOEFL and submit the results."
Is there a minimum TOEFL score required?,"While there is no absolute test score cut-off, the Committee would be concerned that an internet based TOEFL score below 100 might indicate that the candidate does not have sufficient fluency in English to do well in classes here."
Am I eligible for Harvard Housing?,Visiting Undergraduate Students are not offered University housing.  Accepted students must find their own housing before they arrive in Cambridge.
Am I eligible for Financial Aid?,"As a Visiting Undergraduate Student, you will not be eligible for Harvard financial aid and you must secure your own funding."
When Should I Apply?,"The deadline to apply for the Fall Term or a Full Academic Year is April 1st, and the deadline to apply for the Spring Term is October 1st.  Ordinarily students are not allowed to defer admission.  Therefore it is advised that you apply for the appropriate term.  Additionally, we are not able to make early admission decisions for students who wish to apply for a later term."
What is a Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS)?,"Students currently enrolled full-time at an accredited college or university may apply to spend one or two semesters studying at Harvard College. After completing their time at Harvard, the students return to their home school, where Harvard credits are generally accepted, to complete their degree."
Do Visiting Undergraduate Students (VUS) have the same privileges as Harvard Degree Candidates?,"While VUS are not degree candidates and do not receive a diploma from Harvard College, they have access to all libraries, academic, and athletic facilities just like Harvard degree candidates.  VUS are affiliated with Dudley House, the Harvard House for students who live off campus.  If you would like to learn more about life as a Visiting Undergraduate Students and the affiliation with Dudley House visit: https://dudleyundergrad.harvard.edu/visiting-students"
Are Standardized Tests Required as part of the Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS) Application?,"Students whose native language is not English are REQUIRED to submit a TOEFL score not more than two years old. The results of this test are very useful to the Committee as it considers international applicants. Official tests results must be submitted electronically to the Admissions Office from the ETS (code#3434). We do not require SAT, ACT or AP scores to be submitted in order to apply to the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program. However, we encourage students who have taken them to submit their scores, because all information about a candidate is helpful in the admissions process."
Will my financial aid package change?,"Our financial aid award depends on your income, assets, and number of siblings in colleges, among many other factors. As such, changes to these circumstances (or any others) may mean your award is different this year, even if we are using the same year of income."
Will I get my award any earlier this year?,"No. There is no change to our timeline. The application due date for all current students is May 1st, 2017 and award notifications will be sent by July 1st to those students who submit their applications on time."
How can I see what is missing/received and when?,"We will not begin tracking documents for 2017-2018 until mid-February, at which time we will post which documents are received/missing on your my.harvard.edu portal. Until that point, the documents showing on your my.harvard portal will be those from this current school year (2016-2017)."
"If I am usually eligible for a CSS Profile fee waiver, can I get it early?",We will be emailing current students eligible for the CSS Profile fee waiver with the waiver code in mid-February. We cannot provide codes before this timeline.
Is there an advantage to filling out my application earlier?,"No. We will not be officially sending out re-application instructions until mid-February and will be processing applications along our normal timeline, meaning that we will not be tracking submitted materials until late February. Completing your application early will have no impact on your award; please complete your application by the May 1st deadline."
What if my 2016 income is no longer representative of my financial situation?,"You should still complete your application as instructed. As always, if there are special circumstances of which you would like us to be aware, please include a detailed letter with the materials you submit to IDOC so that your circumstances can be reviewed along with the rest of your required application materials."
Do I have to submit my 2016 tax information again?,"Yes. While you are using the same taxes, it is for a new application cycle and a new academic year and we no longer have access to last year's data. You will still need to submit copies of your actual 2016 tax returns and W-2 forms to IDOC."
Should I complete the PROFILE even if my family has not yet filed our current year tax returns?,Yes. You and your parents should use the income information on your W-2 forms or paycheck stubs to estimate the figures that will appear on your tax returns. Such estimates are perfectly acceptable for all students.
Can foreign students use the CSS Profile?,Yes! That is actually the best form to use.
Do I need to do both the CSS Profile AND the Financial Statement for Students from Foreign Countries?,"No. Those two forms are interchangeable. If you are able do the CSS Profile, it is the preferred form."

All requested documents, should be uploaded to IDOC."
How will I know that the PROFILE has been submitted correctly?,You will receive an email confirmation from the CSS after the PROFILE has been submitted.
What is Harvard's School Code for the CSS PROFILE?,Our CSS PROFILE code is 3434.
What should I do if I make a mistake on the PROFILE?,"Once the PROFILE has been submitted, you will not be able to make changes. We understand that the numbers on the Profile may be estimates and will update them with your actual taxes when those arrive through IDOC. If you have major changes or corrections to make beyond those that will be automatically updated by your tax returns, you can print the pages that need changing, write the changes on them, and upload them through the College Board IDOC Service."
What if I am a foreign citizen who is unable to submit a CSS Profile Online?,"The CSS Profile is available to students from nearly every country and nationality. The College Board is unable to process payments from a small number of countries, and so students from these countries may not be able to submit the CSS Profile. If this is the case, please follow this alternate set of instructions to apply for financial aid."
What is Harvard's Federal School Code for the FAFSA?,Our Federal School Code for the FAFSA is E00468.
What should I do if I make a mistake on the FAFSA?,"You may log back in to the FAFSA website, change the erroneous information, and resubmit the FAFSA."
Should I complete the FAFSA even if my family has not yet filed our current tax returns?,"We would prefer that you wait to file your FAFSA until your taxes are complete. If at all possible, please use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to complete the FAFSA. However, if the application deadline is near, you should file the FAFSA using estimates."
How will I know that the FAFSA has been submitted correctly?,"You can check the status of your FAFSA here. Please allow one week for processing an online signature, and three weeks for processing a paper signature page."

I can't pay the Profile fee because the US won't accept credit card payments from my country.,Please follow these alternate instructions for applying through our paper process.
"I can't afford the Profile fee and I'm foreign, so I can't get a College Board waiver.",Please follow our alternate instructions for applying through our paper process.
How can I get a financial aid fee waiver?,"Harvard does not charge a financial aid application fee (we do charge an admissions application fee; if you need to contact the Admissions Office about an admissions fee waiver,  you can do so here.) If you are a US Citizen or Permanent Resident, or Canadian Citizen, you will be required to file the CSS PROFILE, an application independent of Harvard but that will normally require the payment of a fee.  You will automatically be evaluated for a waiver of the PROFILE application fee ($9 registration fee plus $16 per college selected) at the point that you submit your PROFILE data to the College Board.  The College Board is wholly responsible for the PROFILE and will grant a waiver of their fees if they deem it appropriate.  You can contact the College Board to learn more by calling 1-844-202-0524."

What can I do if my family's financial situation is complicated?,Attach a letter to the tax returns you are submitting explaining the special circumstances.

Do I need to apply for a state scholarship?,"Yes, if you are a resident of CT, VT, or DC, you must submit the supplemental state grant application to the appropriate agency. Students who are eligible for state grant funds but fail to follow the procedures and deadlines set by their state grant programs will not receive additional Harvard financial aid to cover lost funding."
What if I am interested only in applying for federal loans (Stafford and PLUS)?,"If you do not intend to apply for need-based grant aid from Harvard but do want to apply for a Federal student or parent loan, please notify us of your intentions and submit only the FAFSA. Once we receive your FAFSA information electronically from the Department of Education, our office will notify you of your loan eligibility."

Current and admitted students can always check the status of their application on my.harvard."
I am undocumented. Am I still eligible for financial aid?,Yes. If you are undocumented you are eligible for financial aid from Harvard. Harvard makes no distinction based on citizenship in the financial aid process or in the amount of aid for which students are eligible.

Applicants who fill out the CSS PROFILE form are contacted by the College Board with instructions on how to submit taxes and other relevant forms to IDOC. You can learn more here.
How will I know that my IDOC materials have been submitted correctly?,"Sign in here. Please allow five or more business days for processing. Remember that the staff at IDOC are only trained to identify basic US tax documents and these are the only ones that will show up on IDOC's tracking. If you have read through our application instructions and submitted what we ask for, then you should not worry about whether IDOC has been able to correctly identify and track your documents. Our staff will review the IDOC materials for all admitted students and current undergraduates to make sure your submissions fulfill our requirements and will reach out if there is anything more we need."
What if my country doesn't have a tax return?,"You should send any documentation they do have. Many families will send a year-end wage statement, or a letter from each employer stating annual compensation."
What if my parents are unemployed or did not file a tax return?,"If your parents are not required to file a federal or national tax return, they should send a signed statement listing all sources and annual amounts of income for their household. Each non-filer must print and complete a tax non-filer statement and submit it to IDOC with the rest of your application materials."
Can I send my tax returns directly to you?,"IDOC is the best method for sending us documents, and is required for all US tax returns. IDOC is available to all students who submit a CSS Profile, whether residing in the US or abroad. Those students were unable to file a CSS Profile and who requested alternate instructions may send their foreign tax returns directly to us by mail or fax as directed by our alternate instructions. Please be sure that anything you send directly to us includes your full applicant name, applicant year, and some other unique identifier (school, birth date, etc.)"
What should I do if my parents or I will be requesting an extension for filing their federal taxes?,"For prospective students, we will be happy to accept your completed application for financial aid whenever it arrives. We do ask, however, that you send your 2016 tax returns to IDOC as soon as possible after they become available. You should not submit 2015 documents unless you are specifically asked for them. If you receive a positive admissions decision and still have not been able to send your 2016 tax returns, please be in touch with us by phone after you receive your admissions decision. For current students, please send a copy of the IRS extension application to IDOC with the rest of your application materials. Please note that we will be unable to calculate your financial aid award until we receive the actual 2016 tax return."
What should I do if the Noncustodial PROFILE is missing?,"If you filed the online PROFILE, your noncustodial parent should complete a Noncustodial Parent's PROFILE online. After you file the custodial parent PROFILE, you will receive instructions from the College Board to send to your noncustodial parent explaining how to complete this process. If you are an international student and chose to file the paper Financial Statement for Students from Foreign Countries, please have your noncustodial parent to complete and submit a separate form along with their most recent tax return or wage statement."
"If my parents are divorced or separated, do they both need to send in financial information?","Yes, your custodial parent should file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the CSS PROFILE Application, and your non-custodial parent should complete the Noncustodial Parent's PROFILE and both should submit their taxes. We feel strongly that both parents have an obligation to support you, and a divorce or separation does not change that obligation. We look at each case individually, and we make every effort to be sensitive to particular family circumstances when deciding how much to ask from each parent. If either parent is remarried, financial information about their new spouse and dependents, if any, should be provided. In this way we obtain the fullest possible picture of your financial background and can make the fairest judgment about your need for assistance. If we have received financial information from both your parents, the figure listed as "parent contribution" on your award letter will be the combined figure for your parent 1 and parent 2, determined by doing a separate need analysis for each. It is up to you and your parents to decide how to divide the responsibility for paying the termbills."
What if I cannot ask one of my parents to send in their financial information?,"If you are unable to ask a parent to send in their financial information, please fill out a Parent Information Sheet including a letter from a third party and any additional documentation as appropriate. Given that every family situation is unique, we review parent and household information on a case-by-case basis to determine what documentation and paperwork is appropriate for that student to provide to us in an effort to be as generous as possible with our financial aid assessment. Since we do not review financial information until a positive admissions decision has been made, we cannot make a judgment call on the documentation required until that point in the process. Please rest assured that our financial aid application deadlines are flexible and that we will be in direct touch with the student, should a positive admissions decision be made and the financial aid application is incomplete."
What should I do if my CSS PROFILE Data is missing?,"Please visit the College Scholarship Service web site www.collegeboard.com to complete the PROFILE or call 1-800-626-9795. The Harvard College CSS code number is 3434. Once your CSS PROFILE has been processed (allow 7 days for CSS to process), you will receive an email from the College Board's Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC) providing you with instructions on how to submit your tax forms and any other supplemental forms that may be required.  Remember, it is important to provide your Social Security Number, if you have one, when you register for CSS PROFILE; Harvard will use this unique number to identify your data before loading any electronic records.  NOTE: If you are a returning student and do not have a Social Security Number, please provide your Harvard ID number in the SSN field when you register for the CSS PROFILE.  If you are a prospective/entering student and do not have a Social Security Number, please be sure to provide the same first, last and middle name, as well as birthdate on the CSS PROFILE that you provided on your Harvard admissions application."
What if tax documents are missing and I have already sent my materials to IDOC?,"Your parents and/or non-custodial parents should upload signed copies of their most recent federal tax return(s) with attending schedules to IDOC. Note that we will not be able to finalize your financial aid award until we receive your actual  federal tax returns with all schedules - these should also be sent to IDOC as soon as they become available.) If you are an international student and a national tax return is not filed, your parents should ask each employer to submit a wage statement detailing their annual compensation. "
What should I do if the CSS Business/Farm Supplement is missing?,You can find the form on our website under Forms and Resources. Please fill out a Business/Farm Supplement for each business and/or farm in which your family has an interest.
What if my student tax return is missing but I didn't file a return?,"If you are not required to file a federal or national tax return, you should complete and submit a tax non-filer statement."
What should I do if a Cash Flow Statement is missing?,You can download the form here. It should be submitted through your IDOC portal.
What if my family's financial situation changes while I am attending Harvard?,You may request a review of your financial aid decision at any time to accommodate significant changes in your family's financial situation. You must apply for financial aid each year. We will meet your demonstrated need for all four years.
Can I apply for Harvard's financial aid independently of my parents?,"No, in 99% of the cases. We feel strongly that your parents have an obligation to help finance your college education. Our aid is available only to students whose families would not otherwise be able to send them to Harvard."
What if my parents refuse to pay for my college education?,"To be fair to all our students, we can base our financial aid decisions only on ability and not willingness to pay, and a decision to attend Harvard must be made by you and your parents. Please call the Financial Aid Office to discuss this further if you have questions or concerns."
What if I cannot ask one of my parents to send in their financial information?,"If you are unable to ask a parent to send in their financial information, please fill out a Parent Information Sheet including a letter from a third party and any additional documentation as appropriate. Given that every family situation is unique, we review parent and household information on a case-by-case basis to determine what documentation and paperwork is appropriate for that student to provide to us in an effort to be as generous as possible with our financial aid assessment. Since we do not review financial information until a positive admissions decision has been made, we cannot make a judgment call on the documentation required until that point in the process. Please rest assured that our financial aid application deadlines are flexible and that we will be in direct touch with the student, should a positive admissions decision be made and the financial aid application is incomplete."
What is a Term-Time Work Expectation?,"The term-time job expectation listed on your award letter is the amount of earnings during the academic year that we expect you to contribute toward your college costs. All earnings are paid directly to you, and it will be your responsibility to determine what portion of your earnings will be used towards billed (tuition, fees, room & Board, etc.) and/or non-billed (travel and personal expenses, etc.) expenses. Students can work while at Harvard, but only some students are eligible for the Federal Work Study Program (FWSP). Your financial aid letter will designate whether you can work in a job funded by FWSP or need to focus your job search on positions not funded by the program. Please note: You may request a student loan to replace or supplement part or all of a job expectation (term-time or FWSP). To request a loan, use the Loan Request Form."
Am I required to work if I am an international student and I qualify for financial aid?,"There is no requirement to work. However, all students, international or American, who demonstrate financial need will have a student term-time contribution as part of their financial aid package, which they can typically meet with a job requiring about 10-12 hours per week. U.S. immigration regulations allow foreign nationals to work on-campus only, and they restrict the amount of time a foreign student can spend working while attending college. Jobs are plentiful and are often interesting and relevant to academic interests."
Is it easy to find a student job on or near campus?,"Jobs are plentiful at Harvard. Employment opportunities range from dining hall duties to work in the University's libraries, laboratories, and offices. Students have also earned money on campus as bartenders, teaching assistants, sportswriters, computer programmers, lifeguards and research assistants, to cite a few examples. Working eight to twelve hours on average per week, most students find that they can work, excel academically, and participate in a range of extracurricular activities. Read more at our Student Employment Office website."
What is the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP)?,"Your aid package will indicate if you are eligible for the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP) also known as "work-study." Many aid packages list "Term-Time Job" as opposed to FWSP. This means that you are encouraged to find a job to help cover your costs although you are not eligible to work in FWSP-only jobs. There are many non-FWSP jobs available on campus as well, and last year close to 65% of all Harvard students chose to work during the year. FWSP is a wage subsidy program designed to expand your range of employment opportunities both on and off campus. FWSP is a federal financial aid program and thus it is not an option for international students or students who are not receiving federal aid. The FWSP wage-subsidy allows employers to hire students at wages they might not otherwise be able to afford because the federal government will pay roughly 70% of student earnings. Visit the Student Employment website to log into the jobs database to look for FWSP and non-FWSP jobs with your HUID and PIN at www.seo.harvard.edu."
Where can I find parent financing information?,"Many of our families find parent loans to be a useful tool for spreading the cost of education over a number of years. Parents may borrow up to the full cost of education, less any other financial aid. Parent loans are not based on financial need, and there are no income restrictions or penalties for early repayment. Harvard processes PLUS loans directly with the U.S. Department of Education through the Federal Direct Lending Program, without the need for banks and for-profit lenders. However, your financing options are not limited to the parent PLUS loan; you and your family may borrow from any lender you choose."
Are loans available if I choose not to work?,"If you will have heavy extracurricular demands on your time (such as playing football in the fall or acting in a spring drama production), you could choose to meet the job expectation completely through student loans."
What happens to my financial aid award if I receive additional outside assistance?,"A large percentage of each entering freshman class receives one or more outside awards from national or local organizations. When adjusting the Harvard financial aid package, 100% of the total outside award amount is first deducted from your job expectation, and then from your summer earnings expectation, up to the total amount of those expectations. If the total of outside awards exceeds the combined amount of your job and summer earnings expectations, that excess amount is deducted from the Harvard Scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that help to meet need, they may not be used to replace your parents' contribution or other expected family resource. For example, if you were originally offered a financial aid package with a $3,000 job, a summer earnings expectation of $1,600, and a $15,000 Harvard Scholarship and subsequently receive a $2,000 National Merit award and $2,000 from the Elks Club, then we will reduce your term-time job expectation to $0 and your summer expectation to $600. Only if outside awards exceeded $4,600 would they have any impact upon the amount of Harvard Scholarship."
What do I need to do to Report Outside Award(s)?,"If you expect to receive an outside scholarship that is not reflected on your award letter, including tuition benefits from parents' employers, you should report it to the Financial Aid Office by visiting the Outside Award Reporting System (OARS). We will adjust the financial aid package to reflect the receipt of additional resources."
Where should I send outside award checks?,"Checks are processed by the Student Accounts Office (not the Financial Aid Office). Please send your checks to: Harvard University Student Accounts953 Smith Campus Center1350 Massachusetts AveCambridge, MA 02138 "
Where should I send Cost of Attendance or Verification of Enrollment forms?,"If an outside organization is requiring you to have a Cost of Attendance or Verification of Enrollment form signed by an official at Harvard, please use the following: Cost of Attendance Forms: Harvard CollegeGriffin Financial Aid OfficeAttn: Outside Award Coordinator86 Brattle StreetCambridge, MA 02138 Verification of Enrollment: Please visit the website of the Office of the Registrar.   "
Where do I request a refund from my term bill account?,You may request a refund here.
Is there financial aid available for foreign students?,"Yes, on exactly the same basis as for American students. Although foreign students are not eligible for any federal funding, the College has its own job and scholarship money available to foreign students."
Will Harvard provide travel expenses for international students who receive financial aid?,"All students, American and international, who are on financial aid have a travel allowance included in their financial aid award to help cover the cost of travel to and from Cambridge. Overseas students are advised to seek information from the nearest U.S. Cultural Affairs Office about travel grants and other financial assistance available to qualified students from various foundations and from the U.S. government."
How do you determine eligibility for Harvard Scholarships?,"We determine your financial aid award based solely on your family's demonstrated financial need. Our program is designed to help families across the economic spectrum, from low to upper-middle incomes. Aid is completely need-based and considers many factors, such as your family's income, assets, size, and unusual expenses. There are no merit-based awards, and we have no preferential packaging policies that give some students more attractive awards than others."
Are there any merit-based financial aid awards at Harvard?,"No, we admit students based on their strengths and talents, but all Harvard-administered aid is based only on financial need, and we treat all admitted students equally in terms of their eligibility for that aid."
What are travel and personal expense allowances?,"Travel: An allowance toward the cost of traveling to and from Harvard has been included in your budget on your award letter and used in calculating your eligibility for financial aid.  You are responsible for booking and paying for your own travel. Many students will use the money they earn over the summer to meet the costs of travel to and from Harvard. Personal Expenses: The estimated cost for books, supplies, clothing, laundry, telephone, entertainment, local transportation, and other incidentals has been included in the personal expenses portion of your budget. Students generally spend between $800-$1200 on books over the course of both semesters. You are responsible for paying your own personal expenses. Many of the students will use money earned at their term-time jobs to cover personal expenses."
What should I do if my permanent address changes?,Please email us and inform us of your new address. You will also need to file a change of address with the Student Data Office in the Office of the Registrar.
What should I do if I am returning from a leave of absence?,"Please notify our office if you are returning from a leave of absence. The same instructions and deadlines apply, regardless of whether you intend to return in the fall or spring semester. Make sure that you are current with loan repayments and that you file the necessary deferment or forbearance forms when you register. You may want to check the status of your student loans by calling the Student Loan Office at (617) 495-3782. In addition, your term bill from previous semesters must be paid in full."
Are deferred students still eligible for financial aid?,Yes. You are considered for financial aid no matter when you are admitted.
Does applying for financial aid affect my chances for admission?,No. Your financial circumstances are never an impediment to admission. Foreign students have the same access to financial aid funding as do U.S. citizens.
Is it easy to qualify for financial aid at Harvard?,Yes. No American college has a more generous financial aid program. See how affordable Harvard can be. [Net Price Calculator]
Does Harvard participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program and/or ROTC?,"Harvard University is proud to help veterans continue their education by participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program. As a part of the University, the Harvard College Financial Aid Office will be administering Yellow Ribbon Funds for its eligible undergraduate students. The aid provided by the government will be treated like all outside awards , and students will receive a matching amount from the College. Eligibility for the Yellow Ribbon Program is determined by the Veterans Affairs Administration and not by Harvard College.Students interested in ROTC opportunities, please visit the following service websites:  Army ROTC (scholarships)  Air Force ROTC website.  Navy ROTC"
What happens if my program's estimates differ from the standard amounts?,You can provide that information on your Study Abroad Supplement for review by the Financial Aid Office.
How do you determine my study abroad personal expenses allowance?,"The personal expenses allowance of your budget is meant to help toward your daily living expenses (separate from your Room and Board) while enrolled in your study abroad program. As expenses can vary greatly based on each student's discretion, we are not able to meet every student's individual expenses. Rather, we build an allowance toward them in your budget, but leave the daily choices to you. For instance, in regard to local travel expenses, we might be able to offer you financial aid toward commuting from your apartment to your school campus, but we wouldn't be able to offer you scholarship toward a traveling tour that is separate from your program. However, we recognize that you may want to take advantage of your time away from Cambridge, and we encourage you to make your time abroad enriching and educational in the broadest sense. We may be able to offer you subsidized loan to help you expand the scope of your experience abroad, and allow you a wider range of choices."
Do I have to pay for health insurance when I'm abroad? Is that the same thing as the Health Services Fee?,"Please be aware that it is your responsibility to make sure that you have the appropriate health insurance coverage, whether you are studying on campus or abroad. All students are required to have health insurance, and the Harvard Blue Cross/ Blue Shield health insurance is automatically charged to each student's termbill at the beginning of each semester. If you are covered under your family's health insurance policy, you may be eligible to waive the Harvard health insurance. It is your responsibility to pursue the health insurance waiver, and University Health Services can help you with that decision. The Health Fee and the Student Services Fee are the two mandatory Harvard fees, and are automatically charged to each student's termbill at the beginning of each semester. You continue to be responsible for the Student Services Fee while abroad, and we include it in your budget. However, students who are studying abroad are usually eligible to waive the Health Fee. It is your responsibility to pursue the Health Fee waiver, and you should contact University Health Services about the Health Fee waiver."
When will I find out how much aid I will receive for my study abroad?,"If you are applying for the fall semester or the full year, you will be notified at the same time you get your award letter for academic year provided you turned in your Study Abroad Supplement by the deadline. If you are applying for the spring semester, you will be notified in early December."
What happens with the monthly Harvard Student Billing Statement?,"All your financial aid will be disbursed to your Harvard termbill, and we will release your financial aid from your termbill directly to you. Your Harvard statement may take a few months to reconcile. Normally, you will not need to make any payments to Harvard while you are studying abroad unless you are being billed for a Harvard-sponsored program, or if your financial aid does not cover your Harvard Student Services Fee."
Who receives the bill from the study abroad program?,The programs will send the bill to you or your family.
What should I do if my program requires that I make a deposit prior to when my financial aid would ordinarily be disbursed? Does financial aid cover my air travel?,"Usually, the family will pay the deposit and purchase the plane ticket as a part of the family contribution towards educational costs. If you have high financial need or if most of your educational costs are being met with financial aid, then you should contact your financial aid officer. We will work with you either to waive or reduce the deposit, or possibly pay it as necessary. We also may release funds to help you purchase your plane ticket."
Is it more expensive to study abroad?,"Since we use the same expected family contribution whether you are studying at Harvard or abroad, the cost to your family should be the same in both cases. However, if a budget is more than $5,000 above your Harvard standard budget, the costs in excess of that $5,000 threshold will not be eligible for additional scholarship funding. A subsidized loan will usually be available to meet these additional expenses. If while abroad you find that your necessary living expenses are substantially higher than anticipated, please contact your financial aid officer. You may be eligible for additional scholarship or a subsidized loan to help meet these expenses. It is to your benefit to contact your financial aid officer before using credit cards to meet unanticipated expenses. If you are worried that you do not have resources to fall back upon in the case of urgent expenses while abroad, or to allow you to take advantage of discretionary travel or cultural opportunities that may come up, we may be able to offer you an "unexpected expenses loan" in advance of your departure. This is a subsidized loan that you can take out for your time abroad. If you don't end up using the loan funds while abroad, you can simply return them when you return. Interest on these funds does not begin to accrue until 6 months after graduation/withdrawal, so they may be a much better option than credit cards to help you manage expenses."
What should I do if I am planning to Study Abroad for academic credit for part or all of next year?,Please contact our office to determine your budget. Instructions and deadlines are here.
Am I eligible to use financial aid for study abroad?,"If you are receiving financial aid and are approved for academic credit during the academic year at another institution, your aid should be available to help cover your costs. The Office of International Education (OIE) determines your program is eligible for academic credit, and the Financial Aid Office (FAO) will work with you to determine the amount of aid you are eligible to receive for your study."
How does the Financial Aid Office determine my study abroad budget?,"As with your Harvard budget, your study abroad budget will include a combination of billed and non-billed costs. We construct the budget from the program information that you submit on your Supplement, and these costs will include tuition and fees, room and board, and a standard allowance for personal expenses and books. In addition, we will include a standard allowance for air travel to the area of the world in which you will be studying and will include any additional non-discretionary expenses (e.g. visa/passport costs, medical expenses for required shots) that are specific to your program. Lastly, you will continue to be billed for the Harvard Student Services Fee during the semester(s) that you are abroad, so this will be built into your budget."
How do I know if I need to submit a Consortium Agreement?,You will need to get a Consortium Agreement completed if you are attending a program affiliated with a U.S. college or university. Please have this form completed as soon as possible before you go abroad. You do not need this form if you are going on a Harvard program or direct enrolling abroad.
Where do I go for budgeting workshops?,"The Office of International Education (OIE) holds evening study breaks hosted by OIE student advisers to provide budget support. These student advisers have just returned from some of the most popular destinations such at the UK, France, and Spain, and will be able to help you in thinking about your budget. For more information, please contact the OIE. Drop-in hours for budgeting questions are available at the Financial Aid Office (FAO) and the OIE on a walk-in basis to assist students with completing the Study Abroad Supplement. If you would like help with your budget, please bring photocopies of your program descriptions showing anticipated costs as well as your Study Abroad Supplement with you to one of the workshops. Please check the Study Abroad section of our website for the latest information on times and dates of the workshops."
How do I notify the Financial Aid Office about my plans to study abroad?,"Complete the Study Abroad Supplement and return it, along with all supporting documents substantiating your budget, to the FAO. If you are planning to study abroad in the fall semester or for the full academic year, the form is due May 1st. If you are planning to study in the spring semester, the form is due October 31st. Be sure to attach photocopies of your program budget to the Supplement. Please submit the Supplement by these deadlines, even if you do not know all the answers to the questions, as you can always update it later."
How much financial aid will be sent to the program and how much to me?,"The Financial Aid Office takes the anticipated financial aid for the semester(s) and subtracts any balance due to your Harvard term bill, including any back balance from the previous semester. The remaining amount will be refunded to you and you will be expected to make payments to the study abroad program as required."
What if I feel like my living expenses are higher than were anticipated?,"We encourage you to email your financial aid officer. While we do our best to construct an appropriate budget for you in advance based on the information provided by your program, we recognize that you may encounter higher costs during your time abroad. It is definitely to your benefit to contact your financial aid officer before relying on credit cards to help meet the difference in your expenses. We may be able to offer you additional scholarship or a subsidized loan to help with these unanticipated costs."
What happens if I have questions or problems while I am abroad?,"We want you to have an enjoyable and enriching study abroad experience. Although you may be very far away from Cambridge, the Financial Aid Office is still here as a resource to you, and we hope that you will be in touch with our office if we can be of any help to you."
What happens to my loans while I study abroad?,"While studying full-time and working towards your degree, your loans should not go into repayment. If they do, you need to provide written enrollment verification directly from your program either to the Federal Government (for your Direct Loan) or to Harvard (for your Perkins and/or Harvard Loans). You can download the deferment forms from the Student Loan Office. Do not ignore these notices or your loans may go into default."
